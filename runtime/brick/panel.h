// The Brick's screen. VK_KHR_display tears here, so Vulkan renders straight into /dev/fb0: its memory is
// imported as a dma-buf (Allwinner's FBIOGET_DMABUF) and its pages from FirstPage on are linear BGRA8
// render targets. A thread pans to each frame once its fence signals (FBIOPAN_DISPLAY waits for the
// vblank). Frames are 640 x 480, with fb0 set to that mode and the display engine scaling it to the
// panel, which cuts memory traffic. NextUI's mode and page are restored at the end.
